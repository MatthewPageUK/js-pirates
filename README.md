Pirates Ship Game - Vanilla Javascript ES6

Demo - http://mjp.co/js/pirates/

It will be a fun game involving trading and fighting on the high seas. Fight other pirates and war ships, raid cargo ships and trade at ports.

For now it's just a random world created with a noise script, and a ship to explore the world in.

Objective - stay alive...
